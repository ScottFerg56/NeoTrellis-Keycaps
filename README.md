Load the "Trellis Keycap.f3d" file int Fusion 360
At this point you should save the design AS another name for this new keycap to preserve the original for future use.
INSERT > Insert SVG
Insert from my computer...
Select the downloaded SVG icon
Select the bottom face of the keycap top from the inside
Move the icon with the square box
Size the icon with the white arc
You can use the full space of the inner face of the top
We're operating from the inside to better visualize those sizing limits
The bigger the icon, the better for most purposes
You may need to flip the icon horizontally as we're coming from the inside
OK to finish SVG insertion
I've found some icons to not be properly closed or complete
You may want to continue editing the sketch to fix this or modify the icon
Finish Sketch
Click inside the outline of the icon in the sketch
This may require using ctrl+click to select multiple parts
Press 'E' to extrude the outline(s)
Enter a distance of -0.5 to cut into the face
This is the thickness of the top
If you modified that thickness, you'll need to specify that value here
Or you can spcify 'All' as the Extent Type
Specify a 'Cut' Operation
OK
Make the icon sketch visible again (the eye icon in the object browser tree)
Reselect the icon outline(s)
Press 'E' to extrude again
Specify the same distance as before
Select 'New Body' as the operation
OK
That may be all you need to do
I like to visualize a clear icon by changing its icon to glass
Press 'A' for the APPEARANCE dialog
You should see some preloaded materials 'In This Design'
The black was used on the keycap's body
Click and apply the glass material to the icons part(s)
Close
Save the design
Right-click the design name at the very top of the component browser
Save As Mesh
I use the OBJ Format since that retains information about the materials used 
OK (for the defaults)
change the Name if you like
check Save to my computer and select a path if you like
Save
I use Bambu Studio and the Bambu X1 Carbon with the AMS system to print with multiple filaments.
That lets me easily map from the OBJ file's materials to the filaments in the AMS.
I chose black and transparent filaments
This takes less than 20 minutes to produce a nice print.
Slide the new keycap onto your Trellis button and move on to the next one!
